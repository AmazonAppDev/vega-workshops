# Next steps: Build a streaming TV experience with an AI prompt

In this step, you'll extend the app by using an AI coding assistant to turn the workshop app into a small streaming-style TV experience.

The prompt also leverages Amazon Devices Builder Tools (ADBT) so the assistant can build, launch, and validate the Vega app.

This builds on the same shared components, platform-specific files, and D-pad focus patterns you used in the earlier steps. The difference is that you'll give the coding assistant a larger prompt, then change that prompt to try your own ideas.

The prompt turns the Hello World screen into a small streaming-style TV experience with:

- A large featured movie
- A horizontal row of movies
- D-pad focus that updates the featured movie
- Simple video playback
- Shared code for Vega, Expo TV, and web

## Completed app

After implementing the prompt, the final browse screen should look similar to this:

![Completed streaming TV app showing the featured movie and horizontal movie row](./images/step-07-streaming-app-vega.png)

The result is inspired by the [React Native Multi-TV App Sample](https://github.com/AmazonAppDev/react-native-multi-tv-app-sample), but keeps the app small enough to explore during the workshop.

## Explore the example

Open the sample app and look for:

- How the focused movie stands out
- How focus changes the large image and title
- How a movie opens in the video player
- Which parts are shared between platforms

Use it for ideas rather than copying the whole app.

## Review the prompt

The prompt is in [`workshop/prompts/streaming-tv-prompt.txt`](./prompts/streaming-tv-prompt.txt):

```bash
cat workshop/prompts/streaming-tv-prompt.txt
```

It gives the coding assistant more detail than a normal workshop step because it describes the screen, focus behaviour, video playback, and checks to run.

You do not need to memorise it. Treat it as a starting point that you can change.

## Give the prompt to your coding assistant

Start your coding assistant from the repository root and ask:

```text
Read workshop/prompts/streaming-tv-prompt.txt and implement it in this
repository.

Read the existing workshop files and code first. Keep the implementation simple
and consistent with the patterns already used in the workshop.
```

Let the assistant inspect the project before it starts editing. It should reuse the shared package, scaling helpers, focus patterns, and platform-specific files you have already seen.

## Run and verify

Build and run on Vega. In Vega Studio, click the play button in the sidebar (see [Step 1](./step-01-setup-and-run.md#option-a-build-and-run-from-vega-studio-ide)). Or from the CLI:

```bash
yarn vega:build
yarn vega:vvd:mseries  # or yarn vega:vvd:intel
```

Use the D-pad to move through the movie row and check that:

1. The first movie is focused.
2. Pressing Right updates the large movie image and title.
3. Pressing Select opens the video.
4. Play/Pause works.
5. Back or Exit returns to the movie row.

Use the Virtual Device remote for this functional check.

Now run on web:

```bash
yarn expotv:web
```

Wait for Metro to report that the web bundle completed, then open the local URL
it prints. A successful TypeScript check alone does not confirm that Metro can
resolve the web application.

## Troubleshooting the generated app

- **A video returns 403 or stays blank:** Replace it with a reachable HTTPS MP4
  URL. Public sample media URLs can change or restrict where they are used.
- **The controls disappear and the remote stops responding:** Keep hidden
  controls mounted or restore focus when showing them. Unmounting the focused
  button loses the D-pad focus target.
- **Vega shows no video:** Confirm that the W3C Media dependency, Babel setup,
  manifest services, and required W3C Media modules from the prompt were all
  added.

## Try another feature

The prompt is meant to be edited. Try adding one more feature and ask your coding assistant to update the app.

For example:

- Add another movie row
- Add a movie details screen
- Add a Continue Watching row
- Change the colours and card sizes
- Add a search button
- Add captions or playback progress

Keep the first change small, build the app again, and check that D-pad focus still works.

## What you've learned

- **Prompt as a starting point**: A detailed prompt can give a coding assistant enough context to build a feature.
- **Reusing workshop patterns**: The same shared components and platform-specific files work for a larger TV experience.
- **Experimenting safely**: You can start with a small change to the prompt, rebuild, and check the result.
- **Run and verify**: Generated code still needs to be built and tested on each platform.

---

**Workshop complete:** You have built a shared multi-platform TV app, compared two list components, and created a starting point for further experiments.
