# Step 5: Replace Test & Debug with a movie list

In this step, you'll replace the **Test & Debug** tile with a **Movies** tile that fetches a movie catalog from a public endpoint and renders it as a horizontal list. On Expo TV and web you'll use `FlatList`. On Vega you'll use the TV-optimised **Carousel** from `@amazon-devices/vega-carousel`.

This builds on the fetch pattern from [Step 4](./step-04-add-api-demo.md) — the httpClient you wrote there does the network call. What's new is how the same fetched data flows into different list components per platform.

## 5.1 Add a catalog service and hook

You'll reuse the `createHttpClient` you built in Step 4. Create `packages/shared/src/data/catalog.ts`:

```tsx
import {useState, useEffect} from 'react';
import {createHttpClient} from '../services/httpClient';

export interface Movie {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  category: string;
  genres: string[];
  rating_stars: number;
  release_year: number;
  images: {
    poster_16x9: string;
  };
  description: string;
}

export interface Catalog {
  catalog_version: string;
  updated_at: string;
  items: Movie[];
}

const CATALOG_URL = 'https://giolaq.github.io/scrap-tv-feed/catalog.json';

const catalogClient = createHttpClient();

export async function fetchCatalog(): Promise<Catalog> {
  const response = await catalogClient.get<Catalog>(CATALOG_URL);
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Catalog request failed with status ${response.status}`);
  }
  return response.data;
}

export interface UseMoviesResult {
  movies: Movie[];
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

export function useMovies(): UseMoviesResult {
  const [movies, setMovies] = useState<Movie[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let cancelled = false;
    fetchCatalog()
      .then(catalog => {
        if (!cancelled) {
          setMovies(catalog.items);
          setLoading(false);
        }
      })
      .catch(err => {
        if (!cancelled) {
          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Unknown error');
          setLoading(false);
        }
      });
    return () => {
      cancelled = true;
    };
  }, []);

  return {movies, loading, error};
}
```

The `cancelled` flag stops us setting state on an unmounted component — easy to trip over when a user navigates away mid-fetch on a TV.

## 5.2 Create a shared MoviePoster component

Create `packages/shared/src/components/MovieList/MoviePoster.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, {useState, useCallback} from 'react';
import {View, Text, Image, Pressable, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';
import {scaleFontSize, scaleWidth, scaleHeight} from '../../utils/scaling';
import {Movie} from '../../data/catalog';

export interface MoviePosterProps {
  movie: Movie;
  hasTVPreferredFocus?: boolean;
}

export const MoviePoster = ({movie, hasTVPreferredFocus}: MoviePosterProps) => {
  const [focused, setFocused] = useState(false);

  const onFocus = useCallback(() => setFocused(true), []);
  const onBlur = useCallback(() => setFocused(false), []);

  return (
    <Pressable
      onFocus={onFocus}
      onBlur={onBlur}
      hasTVPreferredFocus={hasTVPreferredFocus}
      style={[styles.container, focused && styles.containerFocused]}>
      <Image
        source={{uri: movie.images.poster_16x9}}
        style={styles.poster}
        resizeMode="cover"
      />
      <Text style={styles.title} numberOfLines={1}>
        {movie.title}
      </Text>
      <Text style={styles.meta}>
        {movie.release_year} · {movie.rating_stars.toFixed(1)}★
      </Text>
    </Pressable>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: scaleWidth(480),
    marginRight: scaleWidth(30),
    opacity: 0.3,
  },
  containerFocused: {
    opacity: 1,
    transform: [{scale: 1.05}],
  },
  poster: {
    width: scaleWidth(480),
    height: scaleHeight(270),
    borderRadius: scaleWidth(12),
    backgroundColor: '#222',
  },
  title: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontSize: scaleFontSize(32),
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    marginTop: scaleHeight(12),
  },
  meta: {
    color: '#CCCCCC',
    fontSize: scaleFontSize(24),
    marginTop: scaleHeight(4),
  },
});
```

## 5.3 Create a FocusRow wrapper

Both list variants (FlatList and Carousel) need the same thing from their container: something that pulls D-pad focus in and remembers which child was last focused. Every platform has this primitive under a different name — wrap the differences behind a shared `FocusRow` using platform file extensions, same pattern as `HeaderLogo` in Step 2.

`packages/shared/src/components/FocusRow/FocusRow.tsx` (Android TV and Apple TV, via `react-native-tvos`):

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {ViewStyle, StyleProp} from 'react-native';

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires
const {TVFocusGuideView} = require('react-native');

export interface FocusRowProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
  contentContainerStyle?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
}

export const FocusRow = ({children, style, contentContainerStyle}: FocusRowProps) => {
  return (
    <TVFocusGuideView autoFocus style={[style, contentContainerStyle]}>
      {children}
    </TVFocusGuideView>
  );
};
```

The other two variants use the same props and body — only the wrapper changes:

- **`FocusRow.web.tsx`** — swap `TVFocusGuideView` for a plain `View` (browsers don't have TV focus).
- **`FocusRow.kepler.tsx`** — import `TVFocusGuideView` from `@amazon-devices/react-native-kepler` instead of `react-native` (Vega's guide lives in a separate package).

`autoFocus` does the work: when focus enters the row, the guide re-focuses whichever child was last focused (or the first focusable child on first visit).

## 5.4 Create the FlatList variant

Create `packages/shared/src/components/MovieList/MovieList.tsx`. This is the default, used by Web, Android TV, and Apple TV:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  FlatList,
  StyleSheet,
  ActivityIndicator,
  Text,
  View,
} from 'react-native';
import {useMovies, Movie} from '../../data/catalog';
import {MoviePoster} from './MoviePoster';
import {FocusRow} from '../FocusRow/FocusRow';
import {scaleFontSize, scaleWidth, scaleHeight} from '../../utils/scaling';

export const MovieList = () => {
  const {movies, loading, error} = useMovies();

  if (loading) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.centered}>
        <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#FFFFFF" />
      </View>
    );
  }

  if (error) {
    return (
      <View style={styles.centered}>
        <Text style={styles.error}>{error}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }

  return (
    <FocusRow style={styles.container}>
      <FlatList
        horizontal
        data={movies}
        keyExtractor={(item: Movie) => item.id}
        renderItem={({item, index}) => (
          <MoviePoster movie={item} hasTVPreferredFocus={index === 0} />
        )}
        showsHorizontalScrollIndicator={false}
        contentContainerStyle={styles.content}
        style={styles.list}
      />
    </FocusRow>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: '100%',
    height: scaleHeight(400),
  },
  list: {
    width: '100%',
  },
  content: {
    paddingHorizontal: scaleWidth(20),
    paddingVertical: scaleHeight(20),
  },
  centered: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  error: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontSize: scaleFontSize(40),
  },
});
```

A few things worth noticing:

- **`FocusRow` wraps the `FlatList`.** `autoFocus` pulls D-pad focus into the list, and the native `ScrollView` inside `FlatList` scrolls the focused poster into view on its own — same visual outcome as the Vega Carousel, no `scrollToIndex` needed.
- **`container` has a fixed `height`.** Without it the `FlatList` stretches vertically and overlaps the tile row below.

## 5.5 Create the Vega Carousel variant

For Vega, swap `FlatList` for the Amazon Devices Carousel. It has a slightly different API — a `dataAdapter` object instead of a `data` array — but the same `useMovies` hook feeds it. Create `packages/shared/src/components/MovieList/MovieList.kepler.tsx`:

```tsx
import React, {useCallback} from 'react';
import {Text, ActivityIndicator, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';
import {Carousel, CarouselRenderInfo} from '@amazon-devices/vega-carousel';
import {useMovies, Movie} from '../../data/catalog';
import {MoviePoster} from './MoviePoster';
import {FocusRow} from '../FocusRow/FocusRow';
import {scaleFontSize, scaleWidth, scaleHeight} from '../../utils/scaling';

export const MovieList = () => {
  const {movies, loading, error} = useMovies();

  const getItem = useCallback(
    (index: number) =>
      index >= 0 && index < movies.length ? movies[index] : undefined,
    [movies],
  );
  const getItemCount = useCallback(() => movies.length, [movies]);
  const getItemKey = (info: CarouselRenderInfo<Movie>) => info.item.id;
  const notifyDataError = () => false;
  const renderItem = (info: CarouselRenderInfo<Movie>) => (
    <MoviePoster movie={info.item} />
  );

  if (loading) {
    return <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#FFFFFF" style={styles.centered} />;
  }
  if (error) {
    return <Text style={styles.error}>{error}</Text>;
  }
  if (movies.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <FocusRow style={styles.container}>
      <Carousel
        dataAdapter={{getItem, getItemCount, getItemKey, notifyDataError}}
        renderItem={renderItem}
        uniqueId="movie-carousel"
        hasPreferredFocus={true}
      />
    </FocusRow>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    width: '100%',
    height: scaleHeight(400),
    paddingHorizontal: scaleWidth(20),
  },
  centered: {flex: 1},
  error: {color: '#FFFFFF', fontSize: scaleFontSize(40)},
});
```

A few things worth noticing:

- **`dataAdapter` replaces `data`.** The Carousel doesn't take an array — you give it `getItem`, `getItemCount`, and `getItemKey` so it can recycle views for very large catalogs.
- **`getItem` must return `undefined` for out-of-bounds indices.** The Carousel probes past the current count during scroll; returning `movies[index]` directly (which is `undefined`) crashes native code that expects a valid item.
- **`hasPreferredFocus={true}`** makes focus jump straight to the first poster the moment `MovieList` mounts — no extra Up press. It doesn't retrigger on return, so the user can navigate away normally.

Everything else uses the Carousel's defaults; see the [Vega Carousel docs](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/vega-api/0.24/vega-carousel.html) if you want to tune.

## 5.6 Add the Vega Carousel dependency

Update `packages/vega/package.json` to include the new package:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@amazon-devices/vega-carousel": "^0.1.0",
  ...
}
```

Then reinstall:

```bash
yarn
```

## 5.7 Replace the Test & Debug tile

Open `packages/shared/src/data/tiles.tsx` and swap the `debug` tile for a `movies` tile:

```tsx
{
  id: 'movies',
  label: 'Movies',
  accessibilityLabel: 'Movies',
  description:
    'A horizontal list of movies fetched from a public endpoint. FlatList on Expo TV and web, Carousel on Vega.',
  icon: require('../assets/debug.png'),
},
```

We're reusing the existing debug icon to keep the workshop simple. Swap it for something more movie-shaped if you like.

## 5.8 Render the MovieList when Movies is focused

Update `packages/shared/src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` to render the list when the Movies tile is focused:

```tsx
// Add the import at the top
import {MovieList} from '../components/MovieList/MovieList';

// Then in renderFocusedContent, add the movies case above the fallback:
if (activeTileId === 'movies') {
  return <MovieList />;
}
```

Metro picks the right file automatically — `MovieList.kepler.tsx` on Vega, `MovieList.tsx` everywhere else. Same import path, no `Platform.select()` needed.

### Split "active" from "focused" so focus can leave the tile row

`HomeScreen` currently uses one variable — `focusedTileId` — to track both "which tile owns the content area" and "which tile is highlighted". That breaks the moment focus needs to leave the tile row and enter the Carousel above: clearing it unmounts the MovieList; not clearing it leaves the Movies tile lit orange while a poster is also focused.

Split the one variable into the two things it was actually tracking:

```tsx
const [activeTileId, setActiveTileId] = useState<string>('home');
const [focusedTileId, setFocusedTileId] = useState<string | null>('home');

const handleTileFocus = useCallback((id: string) => {
  setActiveTileId(id);
  setFocusedTileId(id);
}, []);

const handleTileBlur = useCallback(() => {
  setFocusedTileId(null);
}, []);
```

`activeTileId` never goes null, so the content area stays mounted while focus travels up into it. `focusedTileId` goes null on blur so the tile's orange highlight clears when focus moves into the Carousel.

`Tile` also gets a third visual state so it can show "I own the content but I don't have focus" — **active** sits between **default** and **focused**. In `packages/shared/src/components/Tile.tsx`, add an `isActive?: boolean` prop and pick the right style block:

```tsx
export interface TileProps {
  // ...existing props
  isFocused: boolean;
  isActive?: boolean;
  // ...
}

const stateStyle = isFocused
  ? styles.focused
  : isActive
    ? styles.active
    : styles.default;

return (
  <TouchableOpacity style={[styles.tile, stateStyle]} /* ... */>
    {/* ... */}
  </TouchableOpacity>
);
```

Add the `active` style and give the base `tile` a `borderWidth` so the outline doesn't nudge the layout when it appears:

```tsx
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  tile: {
    // ...existing
    borderWidth: scaleWidth(6),
  },
  default: {
    backgroundColor: '#0074B8',
    borderColor: 'transparent',
  },
  active: {
    backgroundColor: '#0074B8',
    borderColor: '#B3E5FC',
  },
  focused: {
    backgroundColor: '#FF6200',
    borderColor: '#FF6200',
    transform: [{scale: 1.1}],
    opacity: 1,
  },
  // ...
});
```

Now wire the new state through in `HomeScreen`:

```tsx
<Tile
  key={tile.id}
  // ...existing props
  isFocused={focusedTileId === tile.id}
  isActive={focusedTileId !== tile.id && activeTileId === tile.id}
  onFocus={handleTileFocus}
  onBlur={handleTileBlur}
/>
```

Finally, rename `focusedTileId` to `activeTileId` in the parts of `renderFocusedContent` that decide what to show (and `focusedTile` to `activeTile` in the fallback). The header area follows the active tile now, not focus — that's how the Movies content stays mounted after focus leaves the tile row.

### Wrap the tile row in FocusRow

The `FocusRow` from 5.3 fits the tile row too. Without it, pressing **Down** from the Carousel returns focus to whichever tile is geometrically below the focused poster — usually **Home**, not **Movies**. `autoFocus` remembers the last focused child so focus goes back to Movies.

Swap the tile row's outer `<View>` for `<FocusRow>`:

```tsx
import {FocusRow} from '../components/FocusRow/FocusRow';

// ...

<FocusRow
  style={styles.tileRowScroll}
  contentContainerStyle={styles.tileRowContent}>
  {tiles.map(tile => (
    <Tile ... />
  ))}
</FocusRow>
```

Split the styles — outer for the flex slot, `contentContainerStyle` for the layout:

```tsx
tileRowScroll: {
  flex: 1,
},
tileRowContent: {
  flexGrow: 1,
  flexDirection: 'row',
  alignItems: 'flex-end',
  justifyContent: 'space-between',
},
```

Now the full flow works: focus Movies → the Carousel takes focus on mount (via `hasPreferredFocus`) → scroll with Left/Right → press Down → the tile row `FocusRow` remembers Movies was last focused and puts focus back there.

### Optional next step: iOS focus tuning

Once you have the movie list working on Apple TV, you'll notice focus doesn't feel quite as smooth as it does on Android or Vega. Everything below is optional — the workshop doesn't ask you to fix it — but it's a useful extension if you want to dig into how the tvOS focus engine really works. Skip straight to 5.9 if you'd rather move on.

You'll also notice focus behaves a little oddly on Apple TV — pressing **Down** from a poster doesn't always return to the Movies tile. It lands on whichever tile is geometrically closest to the focused poster. That's tvOS's proximity-based focus engine overriding the tile row's `autoFocus`. Android TV does something similar in the other direction: pressing **Right** from the Movies tile can jump up into the Carousel rather than moving along to the next tile. Vega doesn't do either.

As a next step, try wiring up `TVFocusGuideView`'s `destinations` prop to override proximity — you point the movie row's focus guide at a ref to the tile row, and Down goes back there regardless of where the poster sits on screen. It's a good exercise in how the tvOS focus engine composes, and a nudge into the parts of `react-native-tvos` that go beyond `autoFocus`.

You may also spot that the first poster only picks up focus on Apple TV once you press **Up** into the movie row — on Android TV and Vega it lights up the moment Movies becomes active. That's `hasTVPreferredFocus` behaving differently across the two platforms. On Android, the underlying view calls `requestFocus()` on itself shortly after mount, so focus gets pulled from the tile onto the poster automatically. On tvOS, the prop just marks the poster as its parent view controller's *preferred focused environment* — tvOS only reads that value during a focus-update cycle, and mounting a subtree doesn't trigger one. Focus stays wherever it was.

Another next-step exercise, then: force a focus-update on iOS after mount. The usual options are calling `requestTVFocus()` on a `ref` inside a `useEffect`, or restructuring so the movie row is inside a `TVFocusGuideView` that already has focus when it renders. Same story as the proximity quirk — tvOS's focus engine is passive, so on iOS you nudge it explicitly.

## 5.9 Export the new pieces

Update `packages/shared/index.ts` so the movie list and hook are part of the shared public API:

```tsx
export {MovieList} from './src/components/MovieList/MovieList';
export {MoviePoster} from './src/components/MovieList/MoviePoster';
export {fetchCatalog, useMovies} from './src/data/catalog';
export type {Movie, Catalog} from './src/data/catalog';
```

## 5.10 Run and compare

Build and run on Vega. In Vega Studio, click the play button in the sidebar (see [Step 1](./step-01-setup-and-run.md#option-a-build-and-run-from-vega-studio-ide)). Or from the CLI:

```bash
yarn vega:build
yarn vega:vvd:mseries  # or yarn vega:vvd:intel
```

Focus the **Movies** tile. You should see a spinner briefly, then a horizontal carousel of posters. Use the D-pad to scroll left and right, and watch how the focused poster scales up.

![Movies tile focused, showing the Carousel of posters on the Vega Virtual Device](./images/step-05-movies-vega.gif)

Now run on web:

```bash
yarn expotv:web
```

Or run on Android TV (`yarn expotv:android`) or Apple TV (`yarn expotv:ios`) if you have those emulators set up — see [Step 1: Run on another platform](./step-01-setup-and-run.md#13-run-on-another-platform). Same fetch, same posters, but rendered by `FlatList`. Scroll with the arrow keys.

## What you've learned

- **Reusing shared services**: Step 4's httpClient handled the network call for a different endpoint with no changes.
- **A shared hook, two views**: `useMovies` centralises the loading/error/data flow. Each list component just decides how to render.
- **`FocusRow` as a cross-platform focus guide**: one abstraction, three platform files. `TVFocusGuideView` from `react-native-tvos` on Android TV / Apple TV, from `@amazon-devices/react-native-kepler` on Vega, plain `View` on web.
- **Splitting `active` from `focused`**: one state per intent avoids doubled focus indicators and lets focus leave the tile row without unmounting the content above.
- **`FlatList` vs `Vega Carousel`**: platform-specific files let Vega use its native Carousel while everywhere else uses `FlatList`. Step 6 compares them on a real Vega device.
