# Multi-TV Hello World Workshop

A hands-on workshop and working reference app for building React Native TV apps that run on Fire TV (Vega OS), Android TV, Apple TV, and the web from a single shared codebase.

## What you'll build in the workshop

You start with a working monorepo that already has a simple tile-based UI. The plumbing (Yarn workspaces, Metro configs, TypeScript setup) is done. Your job is the interesting bits:

- A shared `Header` component that shows a different logo per platform
- A Lottie-powered animated logo with a web fallback
- A shared API demo that fetches data from a public endpoint
- A movie list rendered with `FlatList` on web, Android TV, and Apple TV, and the Vega `Carousel` on Fire TV
- A UI-fluidity comparison between `FlatList` and the Vega Carousel on a physical device
- An additional step to use a prompt to add more TV features 
- The same app running on multiple TV platforms and the web

Along the way you'll learn:

- How to set up the Vega SDK using ADBT (Amazon Devices Builder Tools) via MCP
- Running builds from the Vega Studio IDE or the CLI
- TV-specific patterns: D-pad navigation, focus guides (`TVFocusGuideView`), 1080p scaling
- How a Yarn workspaces monorepo shares code across TV platforms
- Two approaches to platform-specific code: file extensions (`.kepler.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.ios.tsx`, `.web.tsx`) vs. `Platform.select()`
- Adding Vega-wrapped native modules (Lottie, Carousel) and aliasing them via Metro's `extraNodeModules`
- Sharing network logic and hooks across all platforms with a tiny `fetch` wrapper
- Measuring scrolling performance with Amazon Devices Builder Tools or directly with Vega Studio and the CLI
- Using an AI coding assistant with a structured implementation prompt

**`packages/shared`** contains all the cross-platform code: components, screens, scaling utilities, and services. It has no platform runtime of its own, it's consumed by the other two packages.

**`packages/vega`** is the Fire TV app. It uses React Native Kepler (Vega's RN runtime) and imports from `@multitv/shared`. When you run `yarn vega:build`, it bundles the shared code along with the Vega entry point into a `.vpkg` file that runs on Fire TV.

**`packages/expotv`** is the Expo TV app. It targets Android TV, Apple TV, and web using `react-native-tvos` and Expo. It also imports from `@multitv/shared`, so the same components render on all its target platforms.

You write components once in `shared/`, and both `vega/` and `expotv/` consume them. Platform-specific differences are handled via file extensions (`.kepler.tsx`, `.android.tsx`, `.ios.tsx`, `.web.tsx`) or `Platform.select()`. The workshop covers both approaches.

## Notes

The Expo TV app (`packages/expotv/`) was scaffolded from the default Expo TV template. Some boilerplate files from the template (e.g. `HelloWave`, `ParallaxScrollView`, `ExternalLink`) are still present and not used by the shared components. They're harmless but can be removed if you want a cleaner setup.
